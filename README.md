## TRADE MY SKILLS
A Social Site for Sharing Skills

## What Is This Project About?

Trade My Skills is a community-based website where people can learn new skills and share skills they already have, especially in the world of coding and tech.
That’s where Trade My Skills comes in.
We’re building a space where everyone is both a learner and a teacher.

With this project, we want to:

Make coding skills easier to learn in a friendly, supportive environment

Give users a place to share what they know, even if they’re not experts

Encourage peer-to-peer learning instead of learning alone

Help beginners build confidence by teaching as well as learning

Create a small but meaningful tech learning community
